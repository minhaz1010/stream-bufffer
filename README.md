# Stream Copy Movie Project

This project demonstrates the concept of copying large movie files using streams and buffers in Node.js. It also measures the time required to execute the full code or copy the entire file.

## Overview

The Stream Copy Movie Project utilizes Node.js and the file system module (`fs`) to copy large movie files efficiently. By leveraging the power of streams and buffers, the project avoids loading the entire file into memory and instead processes the data in smaller chunks. This approach is particularly beneficial when dealing with large files, as it minimizes memory consumption and allows for faster file copying.

# Stream Copy Movie Project

This project demonstrates the concept of copying large movie files using streams and buffers in Node.js.

## Overview

The Stream Copy Movie Project utilizes Node.js and the file system module (`fs`) to copy large movie files efficiently. By leveraging the power of streams, the project avoids loading the entire file into memory, which can be inefficient and lead to memory constraints when dealing with large files.
